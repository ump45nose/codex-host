# Harness Command Integration Guide

This guide is the short checklist for adding a Harness-specific command to codexhost.

## 1. Define the command

Choose a stable command ID and descriptor:

```ts
{
  id: "dsh.plan",
  invocation: "/plan",
  label: "Plan mode",
  argumentMode: "text",
}
```

Use `none` when the command has no argument and `text` when it accepts trailing text.

## 2. Register it in the owning Adapter

Add the descriptor to the Adapter's command catalog. Implement execution in that Adapter and validate:

- command ID;
- argument shape;
- Session busy state;
- native Harness availability.

Do not add a generic raw-RPC passthrough.

## 3. Add the native translation

Keep native protocol details inside the Adapter and its Transport. Translate native results and events into existing Host semantics.

For commands with visible progress, decide explicitly whether they need:

- a temporary projection Turn;
- existing Item events;
- existing UI projection;
- ordinary history persistence.

## 4. Reuse Host and Renderer routing

The shared command catalog and Host command RPC should not need command-specific branches. The Renderer should consume the catalog through the Composer's independent Harness Commands button and popover. Selecting an argument-free command executes it directly; selecting a text command prefixes its invocation in the current editor and leaves the draft and attachments in place for the ordinary submit path.

The command button belongs to the active external Harness controls, near the Composer's left-side actions. It MUST remain outside the Codex React-managed Slash command list; the independent popover owns its own focus, keyboard navigation, positioning, and scrolling.

Only add Renderer-specific code when the command needs a new presentation or interaction.

## 5. Add focused tests

At minimum, cover:

- command appears in the owning Adapter catalog;
- unknown command is rejected;
- invalid arguments are rejected;
- busy Session is rejected;
- native operation is called with the expected payload;
- success, failure, and cancellation are projected correctly;
- temporary command Turns are not persisted when appropriate;
- the command is isolated from other Harness Threads.

## 6. Validate locally

Run the focused tests for the changed Adapter and Host packages, then run:

```bash
npm run build:typescript
git diff --check
```

For native RPC changes, also verify the request and event sequence against the real Harness when available.

## Current examples: Pi, Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek commands

```text
Renderer command catalog
  -> Composer Harness Commands button
  -> independent command popover
  -> argumentMode none: fixed Host command/execute
     argumentMode text: prefix the Composer, then ordinary turn/start
  -> current Host catalog validation
  -> owning Adapter
       Pi:     native { type: "compact" }
       Grok:   x.ai/compact_conversation { sessionId, userContext? }
       Claude: dedicated transport
               /compact  context compaction
               /init     generate CLAUDE.md
               /recap    one-line session recap
       DeepSeek: commands/list for the current Native Session
                 /compact
                 /dsh-goal [<objective>|clear|edit <objective>|pause|resume]
                   -> native /goal
                 /plan [off|message]
                 -> commands/execute { agentId, line }
  -> existing Host Item projection
  -> temporary Turn cleanup unless the command requires persistence
```

Grok maps optional trailing text to native `userContext`. Claude `/compact`
maps it to custom summarization instructions. `/init` and `/recap` take no
arguments. These commands invoke Harness-native operations and must not be
submitted as Host text Turns.

DeepSeek is dynamic rather than a fixed catalog. The Adapter preserves the relative order of the current Session's native `commands/list` response and maps only valid `compact`, `goal`, and `plan` descriptors to stable codexhost IDs. Missing or incompatible entries disappear; malformed catalogs fail explicitly. Native `feedback` conflicts with Codex Desktop's built-in command of the same name and is not exposed. Native `permission` and `export`, the Client-side `/model`, and unknown future commands are also not exposed through this surface.

The public `/dsh-goal` invocation avoids Codex Desktop's built-in `/goal` command and maps only inside the Adapter to native DSH `/goal`. `/dsh-goal` and `/plan` accept text arguments only. DSH remains the owner of goal and plan state and any model-visible follow-up.

## Boundaries

- The Adapter owns Harness-specific semantics.
- The Host owns registration checks and routing.
- Shared contracts remain Harness-neutral.
- Renderer code must not parse or execute Harness `SKILL.md` files.
- UI DOM selectors are compatibility details, not command contract requirements.
